## 1. General Course Information
### 1.1. Course Details
Coordinating Unit: School of Biosystem and Biomedical Science, College of Health Science
Level: Undergraduate 

### 1.2. Course Introduction
Statistics is fundamental in modern biology because it is integral in the design, analysis, and interpretation of experiments.   
**The main aim of the course is to develop a critical understanding of the foundations of statistical application and data science skills in biological research.**   
The course will introduce concepts and hand-on skills that can help you tackle real-world data analysis challenges. 

## 2. Aims, Objectives & Graduate Attributes
